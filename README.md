## About

Given some static project code in HTML and CSS, I created an interactive memory game by adding some JavaScript and tweaking the existing code. You play by trying to match all 8 pairs of cards. Players are timed as well as given a star rating based on how many moves it takes them to finish the game.

## Built With

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
